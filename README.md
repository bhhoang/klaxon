# Klaxon

<https://github.com/curt/klaxon>

Klaxon aims to be a lightweight 
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) server. It is being developed 
using the excellent [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and 
is written mostly in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Status

At the moment, Klaxon is mostly just a placeholder, but it is being updated 
frequently.

## Author

Klaxon is written and maintained by [Curt Gilman](https://github.com/curt).
