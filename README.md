# Klaxon

<https://github.com/curt/klaxon>

Klaxon aims to be a lightweight, single-author, blog-centric 
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) server. It is being developed 
using the excellent [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and 
is written mostly in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Status

At the moment, Klaxon is, at best, pre-alpha code.
There is no meaningful documentation and no support.
Use it at your own risk.

## Author

Klaxon is written and maintained by [Curt Gilman](https://github.com/curt).
